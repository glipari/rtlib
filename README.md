# What is RTLib?

# Compiling

The first time you want to compile the library, you must invoke

    autoreconf && ./configure

Then, to compile simply type 
  
    make

For the monent, the assumption (encodend in =Makefile.am=) is that metasim
is installed in a sibling directory of rtlib. Such thing will change in 
the future. For the moment, if you need to install metasim somewhere else, 
please consider modifying =Makefile.am= youself.
